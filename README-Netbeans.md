# Netbeans compatibility

This version is compatible with Netbeans version <em>11.2</em>.

Unlike previous versions it is hidden until needed:
1) Hints - suid missing
2) Code inclusion when you implement <code>Serializable</code> in a Class

Where previous versions added two popup menu items in the Insert Code menu.
